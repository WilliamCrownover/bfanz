# TITLE: BFANZ
A MERN stack web application.

## Project Description
Where B Movies get discovered. We are building an app that helps movie enthusiasts share and find unique films to enjoy. We want users to engage with a community of passionate movie goers and have fun marking movies as seen or not seen along with writing unique hook questions to inspire others to watch a film. A user should leave our website feeling proud of their movie culture knowledge or come away with curiosity to watch new movies.
